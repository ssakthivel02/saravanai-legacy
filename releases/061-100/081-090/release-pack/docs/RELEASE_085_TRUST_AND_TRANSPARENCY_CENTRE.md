- `plain_language_summary_required`
- `limitations_required`
- `data_use_required`

## Rollout boundary

This release is an additive engineering foundation. It does not activate production writes,
public access, external billing or autonomous high-impact actions.

## Rollback

Disable the release feature flag, stop new writes, revert the integration commit and restore
the last verified D1 backup when needed. Preserve audit, incident and evidence records.
