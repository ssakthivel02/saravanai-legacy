# Release 181 — AI Runtime Control Plane

        ## Objective

        Control model, agent, tool and retrieval execution through trusted identity, policy, budgets, approvals and runtime kill switches.

        ## Control objectives

        - `trusted_identity_required`
- `bounded_steps_required`
- `production_write_forbidden`
- `kill_switch_required`

        ## Mandatory boundaries

        - Identity and tenant context are server-derived.
        - Default deny and least privilege apply.
        - Material actions require attributable human accountability.
        - Sensitive content is excluded from routine logs and analytics.
        - Evidence references use integrity hashes.
        - Paid services and production writes are not activated by this pack.
        - Legal, regulatory or certification status is not inferred from control mappings.
